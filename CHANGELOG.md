# Changelog

All notable changes to Cortex are recorded here — **this file is the single source of truth for versions**.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versioning follows

release note under [`changelog/`](changelog/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-26 — Marginalia
[Full notes](changelog/0.8.0.md)

### Added
- `practices/` capability category, opening with `code-comments` — comment the *why*, descriptive not narrative, density under the project's rule. Declared `always load` by `lead-backend`, `lead-frontend`, `architect` and `qa-automation`.

### Changed
- `languages/php`, `languages/typescript` and `frameworks/vue` gain a doc-block section covering their own mechanics only, pointing at the shared card; the orphan comment bullet in `lead-backend` now references it.
- `templates/project-context.md.template` prompts for the project's own comment conventions (language, reference format).
- The capability tree is refreshed in all three places that carry it — `README.md`, `agents/capabilities/README.md` and `docs/getting-started.md`; `agents/capabilities/README.md` also names the distinction between stack-resolved and unconditional categories.

### Fixed
- `lead-backend` declared no capability category at all, so the role loaded none — restored to `languages/`, `frameworks/`, `databases/`, `security/` and `practices/`.
- `lead-frontend`'s capability list rendered as a single run-on line (lost newline after `**Categories to load:**`).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-18 — End to End _(Released)_
[Full notes](changelog/0.7.0.md)

### Added
- `testing/` capabilities: framework-agnostic `e2e-testing` and `component-testing`; a `frameworks/vue` card; a `frontend-testing` workflow.
- `regulatory-compliance-writer` role + **@Pag** character.

### Changed
- Symfony reference gains an "End-to-end & functional testing" section **and three more traps that pass every gate**; `lead-frontend` and `qa-automation` now load the `testing/` category.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-13 — Trapdoor
[Full notes](changelog/0.6.0.md)

### Added
- Five Symfony "security traps that pass every gate"; a `qa-automation` role card.

### Changed
- Translated API error responses (translatable HTTP exceptions, never a raw throw) documented in the Symfony card.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-10 — Publishable
[Full notes](changelog/0.5.0.md)

### Added
- A licence and community documentation; CI for the framework layer.

- English throughout (including the archive template); line endings pinned to LF.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-28 — Reuse before create
[Full notes](changelog/0.4.1.md)

### Added

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-20 — Team & developer context tiers (ADR-006)
[Full notes](changelog/0.4.0.md)
